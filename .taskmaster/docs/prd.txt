# NiFiCDC Platform - System Management Module PRD

## Executive Summary

This PRD focuses exclusively on stabilizing and enhancing the System Management module of NiFiCDC platform. The System Management module is the foundation that enables users to configure, test, and monitor data source connections across multiple database types and external systems.

## Current Status Analysis

Based on BrowserMCP analysis of the system management page (http://192.168.2.201:8080/systems):

### Current Implementation Status
- **UI Framework**: 90% complete - Clean layout with system cards, filters, and search functionality
- **Backend API**: 70% complete - Basic CRUD operations implemented but lacking real connection testing
- **Database Models**: 80% complete - System entity with connection info storage
- **Security**: 60% complete - Basic encryption exists but needs enhancement

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Connection Testing**: Non-functional connection test buttons
2. **Real-time Status**: Static status indicators without actual health monitoring
3. **Error Handling**: Limited error feedback for connection failures
4. **Performance**: No connection pooling or optimization
5. **Security**: Connection credentials need better encryption and management

## Product Vision

Create a robust, enterprise-grade system management module that provides seamless configuration, testing, and monitoring of data source connections with real-time health status and comprehensive error handling.

## Target Users
